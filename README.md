# Your-Prework-Guidance

## Description
In an effort to document my journey through this bootcamp, I have succeded in creating very useful tool for anyone out there looking to toe a path similar to mine. 
I have therefore created this guide tagged "Your Prework Guidance", which I believe will be your best bud to help navigate through your prework, and equip you for the challenges ahead.

It covers notes on HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript.

This guide provides you with an articulated guidance to help make your learning experience an easy one.

## Usage
Your Prework Guidance is carefully structured in a manner that makes it easy for you to to follow the course step by step.
The topics are listed in cronological order, i.e HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git, although one might choose to learn Git first as the course requires you to often run Git commands.
At anytime, you can open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. This will list the topics we have learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
